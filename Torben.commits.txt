Hi Mohamed
 
Some comments.
 
In general, the paper would benefit a lot from a running example, introduced as a new Section II or a new subsection in Sec II and used to exemplify in Sec III and IV (and later).
 
The abstract should mention forecasting and stress more clearly that we handle BOTH forecasted and historical values using (the same) models.
 
For the intro, there should be a shorter summary of the main novel contributions
 
The intro discusses (some) related work in a lot of detail so why also have a Related Work section. Either all related work should be in Sec I or the discussion should be more highlevel and the detailed discussion moved to Sec VI.
 
Sec II looks a lot like the demo paper, right ?
 
Sec III:
 
L 1: “necessary definitions” sounds strange
 
L 2: “assume a mathematical model” + next sentences. This is somewhat imprecisely formulated, try to be more precise
 
After def 3: “..meet all error guarantees..” is too vague
 
The problem definition only considers ONE level of models as far as I read it, and not the hierarchical set of models that we actually build. It should-
 
The meaning of the formula in Def 2 is unclear, i.e., what do the three cases mean ?
Using “t” for trend is not good as it can be misunderstood to mean time, I think “tr” is better
Def 2 defines a TYPE of function, but not a real function, I think we should also say that a model M is a function of t (time), i.e., M(t)=…
 
Sec III should state clearly (with cites) which type of model this is
 
Sec III also needs to explicitly handle the fact that our time series is not fixed, but evolving over time (we don’t have a “last”
 
IV.A: “..which meets this requirements for the entire timeseries.” What is “this requirements”
 
There are a number of typos in the text and code
 
IV.B The sentence in line 4 is not completed
 
The explanations in Sec IV are generally ok but would benefit a lot from a running example and associated figures
